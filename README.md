# Caesar_clipher_project
The Caesar cipher is a classic example of ancient cryptography and is said to have been used by Julius Caesar. The Caesar cipher is based on transposition and involves shifting each letter of the plaintext message by a certain number of letters, historically three. The ciphertext can be decrypted by applying the same number of shifts in the opposite direction. This repository contains python code that can encrypt and decrypt a message using Caesar Cipher.
